# DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure
- concept of security by design.
- difference between cloud and on-premises computing. 
- different deployment models. 
- different delivery models. 
- the concept of Infrastructure by Code.
## Security Myths 
- The cloud is secure by design
- The cloud is unsecure by design
- Someone else’s platform means it's someone else’s problem.
## Cloud Computing
A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

### On-premises Computing vs. Cloud Computing
  
| On-premises | Cloud |
| :----:| :----: |
| Manually Provisioned | Self-provisioned |
| Dedicated Hardware | Shared Hardware |
| Fixed Capacity | Elastic Capacity |
| Pay for Capacity  | Pay for Use |
| Capital & Operational Expenses | Operational Expenses |
| Managed via Sysadmins | Managed via APIs |

### 5 characteristics of cloud computing
1. On-demand Self-Services
2. Shared/ pooled Resources
3. Broad Network Access
4. Scalable and Elastic(彈性)
5. Metered(計量) by use

### Cloud Computing Benefit
- Improved security
- Unlimited capacity
- Cost efficiencies
- Time efficiencies
- Power efficiencies
- Improved process control

### Cloud Deployed Models
- **Private**: Cloud infrastructure for a single organization only, managed by the organization or a 3rd party, on or off the premise. 
- **Public**: Cloud infrastructure is available to the general public, owned by an organisation selling cloud service services.  
- **Hybrid**: Combination of cloud types. 
- **Community**: Cloud infrastructure shared by several organization that have shared concern, managed by org or 3rd party.
