# Network Security
## Importance of Network Security 
1. **Protection of sensitive data**: Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as personal data, intellectual property, and financial records, is crucial to protect individuals and organizations from identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.
2. **Compliance with regulations**: Many industries, such as healthcare, finance, and government, have strict regulations regarding data protection and privacy. Network security helps organizations comply with these regulations and avoid legal penalties.
3. **Maintaining productivity**: Network security helps ensure the network is available and performs optimally, allowing employees to work efficiently and without disruption.
4. **Building trust**: A secure network fosters trust between an organization and its clients, partners, and employees, as they can be confident that their data is protected.

## Goals of Network Security - CIA
By using the CIA, organisations can develop a comprehensive network security system that effectively protects their networks and data from various threats and attackers.

1. **Confidentiality(機密性)**. Such as Encryption, Access control(Authentication, *Authorisation*, Accounting(AAA)), and Network segmentation.
   - *Authentication*: Authorization rules make sure users can only perform what are permitted to do. Such as *DAC for desktops, MAC for Networks, and RBAC for Applications*.
2. **Integrity(完整性)**. Such as Hash, Digital signatures, and *Message Authentication Codes(MAC)*.
   - *MAC*: By using a shared secret key to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or a piece of data.
3. **Availability(可用性)**. Such as Redundancy, Load balancing, Disaster recovery planning, Regular maintenance.
